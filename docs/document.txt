Stability Testing Report for API-X (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient X)

Objective:
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the chemical and physical stability of API-X under various environmental conditions including temperature, humidity, and light exposure.

Methodology:
Samples were stored at 25째C/60%RH, 30째C/65%RH, and 40째C/75%RH for up to 12 months. Analytical methods included HPLC for purity and degradation, moisture analysis, and visual inspection.

Findings:
- The primary degradation products are compound A and compound B, which increase significantly at 40째C.
- No significant changes in appearance or moisture content were observed across all conditions.
- Shelf-life of API-X is estimated to be 24 months under normal storage.

Conclusion:
API-X is chemically stable under standard ICH conditions. The primary degradation pathways involve hydrolysis and oxidation, particularly at elevated temperatures.
