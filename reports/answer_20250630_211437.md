The stability of an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API), in this case, API-X, is a critical factor in determining its shelf life and efficacy. The stability of an API refers to the ability of the API to maintain its chemical and physical integrity over time. This stability can be influenced by various factors, including storage conditions such as temperature, humidity, and light exposure.

In the case of API-X, it has been found that its stability is significantly influenced by storage temperature. Specifically, the study indicates that the primary degradation products, compound A and compound B, increase significantly when the storage temperature is raised to 40°C. Degradation products are substances resulting from a chemical reaction, in this case, the breakdown of API-X. The increase in these degradation products suggests that higher temperatures can accelerate the degradation of API-X.

Accelerated degradation can potentially reduce the shelf life of API-X. The shelf life of a pharmaceutical product is the period of time during which it is expected to remain safe and effective for use, provided it is stored under recommended conditions. If the degradation of API-X is accelerated, it may not remain effective for the expected duration, thus reducing its shelf life.

However, it is important to note that these findings are based on storage at a temperature of 40°C. Under normal storage conditions, the shelf-life of API-X is estimated to be 24 months. This suggests that if API-X is stored under standard conditions, which typically involve lower temperatures, it remains chemically stable and its shelf life is not significantly affected.

In conclusion, while the stability of API-X is influenced by storage temperature, with higher temperatures leading to accelerated degradation, under normal storage conditions, API-X remains stable for an estimated 24 months. Therefore, it is crucial to store API-X under the recommended conditions to ensure its efficacy and shelf life.
