Question: Clarify and simplify this scientific question:

What are the primary degradation products?

Rephrased: What chemical compounds are produced when the substance undergoes chemical degradation?

Clarify the scope and boundaries of the question:

* What type of substance is it? (e.g. chemical, biological, environmental)
* Is it a specific type of degradation (e.g. photochemical, thermal, microbial)?
* Are there any specific conditions or factors that influence the degradation process?

The goal is to provide a clear and concise answer to the question, while also considering the complexities and nuances of the scientific process.

Here is an example of a well-structured and concise answer:

"The primary degradation products of the substance are carbon dioxide, water, and organic compounds. These products are formed through a series of chemical reactions involving the breakdown of the substance's molecular structure. The specific degradation pathways and conditions can vary depending on the substance type, environmental factors, and the presence of catalysts or inhibitors. For example, the photochemical degradation of certain organic compounds can result in the formation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other byproducts. Understanding the degradation products and pathways is crucial for predicting the fate and transport of the substance in the environment."
