The stability of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient X (API-X) is indeed influenced by the storage temperature. This is a common characteristic of many pharmaceutical substances, as temperature can affect the rate of chemical reactions, including those that lead to degradation.

Our research findings indicate that the primary degradation products of API-X, namely compound A and compound B, increase significantly when stored at a temperature of 40°C. This is likely due to the fact that higher temperatures provide more kinetic energy to the molecules, which can increase the rate of chemical reactions, including those that lead to the degradation of the substance. This suggests that higher temperatures can accelerate the degradation of API-X, potentially reducing its shelf life.

However, under normal storage conditions, which typically involve temperatures well below 40°C, the shelf-life of API-X is estimated to be 24 months. This estimate is based on stability studies conducted under controlled conditions, and it implies that if API-X is stored at a temperature lower than 40°C, it should remain stable for up to 24 months.

It's important to note that other factors, such as humidity, light exposure, and the presence of oxygen, can also affect the stability of pharmaceutical substances. Therefore, in addition to maintaining an appropriate storage temperature, it's important to control these other factors to ensure the maximum shelf life of API-X.
