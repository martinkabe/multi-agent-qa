API-X, or Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient X, is a term used to denote the active ingredient in a pharmaceutical drug. The stability of API-X, like many other pharmaceutical substances, is indeed influenced by storage temperature. 

In the context of pharmaceuticals, stability refers to the ability of a drug substance or drug product to maintain its physical, chemical, microbiological, and biopharmaceutical properties throughout its shelf-life. The degradation of a drug substance can lead to a loss of efficacy and/or the formation of degradation products that could be harmful.

The findings you mentioned indicate that the primary degradation products, compound A and compound B, increase significantly at a temperature of 40°C. This suggests that higher temperatures can accelerate the degradation of API-X. The accelerated degradation at higher temperatures is likely due to increased molecular motion, which can lead to more frequent and energetic collisions between molecules, thereby increasing the rate of chemical reactions leading to degradation.

However, under normal storage conditions, which typically involve temperatures below 25°C, the shelf-life of API-X is estimated to be 24 months. Shelf-life is the length of time for which an item remains usable, fit for consumption, or saleable. This implies that if API-X is stored at a temperature lower than 40°C, it should remain stable for approximately 24 months. 

It's important to note that the actual shelf-life could be influenced by other factors such as humidity, light exposure, and the packaging materials used. Therefore, it's always recommended to store pharmaceuticals as per the conditions specified by the manufacturer to ensure their stability and efficacy.
