API-X, or Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient-X, is a substance used in a finished pharmaceutical product (FPP), intended to furnish pharmacological activity or to otherwise have direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease. The stability of API-X is a critical factor as it can significantly impact the safety and efficacy of the final pharmaceutical product.

The stability of API-X is indeed influenced by storage temperature. This is because temperature can affect the rate of chemical reactions, including those that lead to the degradation of pharmaceutical substances. According to the Arrhenius equation, which describes the temperature dependence of reaction rates, the rate of a chemical reaction increases exponentially with temperature. Therefore, a higher storage temperature can accelerate the degradation of API-X.

The findings indicate that the primary degradation products, compound A and compound B, increase significantly at a higher temperature of 40°C. Compound A and Compound B are likely the products of chemical reactions that break down API-X. The increase in these compounds at higher temperatures suggests that the degradation of API-X is indeed accelerated at these temperatures.

However, under normal storage conditions (usually around 25°C), the shelf-life of API-X is estimated to be 24 months. Shelf-life is the length of time that a commodity is considered fit for use. The 24-month shelf-life of API-X indicates that it remains stable for this period under standard conditions, without significant degradation that would affect its safety or efficacy.

Therefore, to maintain its stability and maximize its shelf life, API-X should be stored under normal conditions and not exposed to elevated temperatures. This will help to slow down the rate of degradation reactions, thereby preserving the integrity of API-X and ensuring the safety and efficacy of the final pharmaceutical product.
