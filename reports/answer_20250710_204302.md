API-X, or Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient X, is a term used to denote the active ingredient in a pharmaceutical drug. The stability of API-X is a critical factor in determining its efficacy and safety. Stability refers to the ability of the API to maintain its chemical and physical properties over time. 

The stability of API-X is influenced by various factors, one of which is storage temperature. According to the findings, the stability of API-X decreases significantly at a temperature of 40째C. This is evidenced by the increase in the primary degradation products, compound A and compound B, at this temperature. 

Degradation products are substances resulting from a chemical reaction, in this case, the reaction of API-X with heat. The increase in these degradation products suggests that the API is breaking down, which can lead to a decrease in its potency and potentially its safety. 

This implies that higher storage temperatures can accelerate the degradation of API-X, potentially reducing its shelf life. The shelf life of a pharmaceutical product is the period of time during which it is expected to remain safe and effective for use. 

However, under normal storage conditions, which presumably involve temperatures lower than 40째C, the shelf-life of API-X is estimated to be 24 months. This suggests that if API-X is stored at a temperature lower than 40째C, it should remain stable for approximately two years. 

In conclusion, the storage temperature plays a crucial role in the stability of API-X. To ensure its efficacy and safety, it should be stored at temperatures lower than 40째C.
