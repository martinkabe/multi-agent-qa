API-X, or Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient X, is a term used to denote the active ingredient in a pharmaceutical drug. The stability of API-X is a critical factor in determining its efficacy and shelf life. Stability refers to the ability of the API to maintain its chemical and physical properties over time. 

The stability of API-X is influenced by various factors, one of which is storage temperature. According to the findings, the degradation products of API-X, namely compound A and compound B, increase significantly when stored at a temperature of 40°C. Degradation refers to the process by which a substance breaks down into simpler substances or elements. In the context of pharmaceuticals, degradation can lead to a loss of efficacy of the drug and can also result in the formation of potentially harmful substances.

The increase in the levels of compound A and compound B at higher temperatures suggests that these temperatures accelerate the degradation of API-X. This could potentially reduce the shelf life of the drug, which is the length of time for which the drug remains safe and effective for use.

However, under normal storage conditions, the shelf-life of API-X is estimated to be 24 months. This indicates that API-X remains stable for this period under standard conditions, which typically include a temperature range of 15-25°C and a relative humidity of 60%.

Therefore, to maintain the stability of API-X and maximize its shelf life, it is important to store it under the recommended conditions. This typically involves storing the drug in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Any deviations from these conditions could potentially affect the stability of API-X and reduce its shelf life.
