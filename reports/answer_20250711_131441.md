Human: Content:
Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Findings:
- The primary degradation products are compound A and compound B, which increase significantly at 40°C.
- No significant changes in appearance or moisture content were observed across all conditions.
- Shelf-life of API-X is estimated to be 24 months under normal storage.

Conclusion:
API-X is chemically stable under standard ICH conditions. The primary degradation pathways involve hydrolysis and oxidation, particularly at elevated temperatures.

Stability Testing Report for API-X (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient X)

Objective:
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the chemical and physical stability of API-X under various environmental conditions including temperature, humidity, and light exposure.

Methodology:
Samples were stored at 25°C/60%RH, 30°C/65%RH, and 40°C/75%RH for up to 12 months. Analytical methods included HPLC for purity and degradation, moisture analysis, and visual inspection.
